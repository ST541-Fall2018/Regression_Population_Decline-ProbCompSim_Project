I'm not sure how well my whale data will work. I think I may have more success with this monarch data that I found.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
monarch <- read_csv(here("data", "monarch.csv"))
monarch
plot(monarch$Year, monarch$Acres, main = "Population Decline of Monarch Butterflies", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Hectacre Coverage")
```

```{r}
monarch.ts <- as.ts(monarch$Acres)
acf(monarch.ts)
#decompose(monarch.ts)
```

```{r}

```
