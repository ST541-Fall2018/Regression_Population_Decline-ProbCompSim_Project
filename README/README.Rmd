Project Title: Modeling Population Decline of Endangered Species

Description: In this project, I model the population decline of endangered species and predict when the species may become extinct. This is done via a function that performs the following steps:

    1) Fits several different models
    2) Selects the best model by comparing AIC values
    3) Using fitted values from the best model, simulate many versions of new data
    4) Refit glm's, using original year values and simulated population
    5) Average fits, roughly estimate when population is zero
    5) Show graphically the fit of various models and the residual plot of best model
