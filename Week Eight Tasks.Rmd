```{r}
# Add if statements to separate cts and discrete data
# for discrete, we'll do classic glm, poi, nb, nls
# for cts, we'll do classic glm, exp, beta
# may be helpful to export:
#   plot with each fit
#   aic values
#   residual plots
#   maybe make reco based on aic, subjective
```

```{r}
# Discrete (more common scenario)
# glm, poi, nb, nls
