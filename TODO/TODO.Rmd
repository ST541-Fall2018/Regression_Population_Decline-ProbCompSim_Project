# Outline of Project Goals and Deliverables. 

* Six Weeks Remaining At Creation of this Timeline

## Week Five

* Primary Focus: Research background information. 
    * Find data that is best for my project. 
    * Read on similar topics
    * Identify best modeling approach
    

## Week Six

* Primary Focus: Begin Modeling and Simulations
    * Write code to fit a model to my data
    * Write code to extend to a simulation

## Week Seven

* Primary Focus: Draw Conclusions from Simulations
    * Using simulation output, extract meaninful interpretations. 
    * Answer questions including: does species become extinct from predictions (and if so, when?), include plot of continued decay of species

## Week Eight

* Primary Focus: Continue work with simulation
    * Check previous work.
    * Clean analyses and code
    * Consider expanding to another modeling approach and repeating simulation
    
## Week Nine

* Primary Focus: Begin writing report
    * Construct report outline
    * Compile results
    * Begin writing body of paper

## Week Ten

* Primary Focus: Finish writing report
    * Finish writing report
    * Make appropriate edits
    * Write bibliography
